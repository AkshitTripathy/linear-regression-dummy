Simple Linear Regression With scikit-learn
Let’s start with the simplest case, which is simple linear regression.

There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:

Import the packages and classes you need.
Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations.
Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
Apply the model for predictions.
